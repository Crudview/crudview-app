# CrudView



Crudview is acrowd-sourced local business review where users can submit a review of their products or services.

I built this application using React/Redux for the frontend and Ruby on Rails for the backend, with PostgreSQL to manage the database. I used active model serializer to format my JSON responses, and implemented JSON web user authentication using JSON Web Tokens and the BCrypt library to one-way encrypt user passwords. All styling was accomplished with Sass-compiled CSS and Material UI. Integrated a list of 100 Chinatown restaurants by pulling data from Yelps REST API.
